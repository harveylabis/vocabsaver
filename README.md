# VocabSaver 
An app that looks up the definition of the word and saves it. It can also generate a quiz about the saved words.

The definitions are from [The Online Plain Text English Dictionary](https://www.mso.anu.edu.au/~ralph/OPTED/)

I created this to saved the words in a book and later quiz myself to reinforce that word.
